QGIS Practicals @ ZSL 20-21st July 2015
=======================================

These files are for a workshop on using [QGIS](http://www.qgis.com/) conducted by [Chris Yesson](http://www.zsl.org/users/chris-yesson) & Aisyah Faruk at the Zoological Society of London in July 2015.

The zip files contain sets of GIS layers used to demonstrate practical skills for visualising, processing and analysing GIS data.

The 'walkthrough' pdfs are not intended as handouts, but show a series of screenshots and simple instructions to guide the tutors through the practical.

The workshop was conducted using QGIS version 2.8.
