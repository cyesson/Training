Training materials

These directories contain training material (handouts and data) for workshops conducted by Dr Chris Yesson & colleagues.

These are primarily concerned with GIS and species distribution modelling.

Directories refer to locations and dates of courses (i.e. ZSL201403 is the course conducted at the Zoological Society of London in March 2014).
