# Digital Elevation Models

An introduction to digital elevation models. DEMs are gridded representations of elevation (or depth) data. We can use these models to create new layers (i.e. slope) and contour lines. We can also define & extract topographic features (i.e. hills & mountains).

## Layers

* RockallHattonLatLong.tif - (Geotiff raster) DEM grid showing sea depth around the Rockall & Hatton Banks in the NE Atlantic. (Source [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission V9](http://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html)
* RockallHattonUTM.tif - (Geotiff raster) DEM grid, as above, but reprojected onto a local UTM grid
* Country.kml - (KML vector) Old countries of the world layer
* Octocorals.shp - (Shapefile vector) Point distribution of Octocorals (source [Yesson et al 2012]() & [OBIS](http://www.iobis.org/)
* EtopoColours.qml - (QGIS/QML file) QGIS file storing colour scheme for Digital Elevation Model display.
