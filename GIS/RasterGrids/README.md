## Raster Grids

There are lots of global datasets derived from satellite sensors (e.g. landsat, seawifs). Many of these are freely accessible online.

We can manipulate these layers in QGIS, examining how environmental patterns have changed over time.

This short practical will use the raster calculator to examine change in global grids over time.

## Layers
* SST2000-2004.tif (raster grid) Mean Global Daily Sea Surface Temperature for the period 2000-2004
* SST2005-2009.tif (raster grid) Mean Global Daily Sea Surface Temperature for the period 2005-2009
* SST2017.tif (raster grid) Mean Global Daily Sea Surface Temperature for the year 2017
* All layers from [Ocean Colour Web](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi/l3)
