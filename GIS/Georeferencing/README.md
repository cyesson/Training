# Georeferencing Images

Any pixelated image can be read as a raster and positioned on a map. You can use this to extract data from a map figure in a publication, or place an aerial photograph on a map. This practical shows how to use the georeferencing plugin to define reference points and load an image as a correctly positioned map layer.
