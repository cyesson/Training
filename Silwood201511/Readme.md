# A brief introduction to QGIS

[QGIS](http://qgis.org/ "QGIS Homepage") (short for Quantum GIS) is a user friendly open source Geographic Information System. The QGIS project has been running since 2002 and has tens of thousands of users [around the world](http://plugins.qgis.org/community-map/ "map of registered users"). This open source software is free to download, distribute and use. It is designed to be available on almost all operating systems with a standardized interface. It is a direct competitor to commercial GIS applications such as Arcgis. There is an active developer community working on analytical tool development, and a simple plugin interface that enables users/researchers to write their own 'plugin' tools in the python programming language.


## QGIS resources

The following resources could be useful when starting out with QGIS:
* [The QGIS website](http://qgis.org/ "QGIS Homepage")
* [The QGIS manual](http://qgis.org/en/documentation/manuals.html)
* [How do I do that in QGIS?](http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/How_do_I_do_that_in_QGIS)
* [The open source GIS mailing lists](http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/)

## Data resources
When using a GIS, you need some GIS data.  There are many data available on the web.  Here are some useful sites with freely accessible GIS layers

### Reference
* (http://www.diva-gis.org/Data) A list of free spatial data and links to lots of useful boundary shape files, such as political boundaries, roads, railways, rivers & lakes
* (http://protectedplanet.net/) Protected planet is the new version of the world database of protected areas providing vector files of protected areas

### Elevation/bathymetry
* (http://gdem.ersdac.jspacesystems.or.jp/search.jsp) ASTER GDEM elevation at 1''x1'' (~30m) for land between ~82ºN and 82ºS (requires registration and login)
* (http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/cbanddataproducts.html) SRTM provide global elevation data at a local scale up to 3''x3'' (~90m)
* (http://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html) The SRTM has combined dem & bathymetry grid at 30''x30'' (~1km)
* (http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eu-dem) EU DEM has terrestrial elevation for europe at 25m x 25m resolution
* (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/bathymetry/arctic/arctic.html) Integrated bathymetry/elevation for the arctic. 

### Terrestrial Environment
* (http://www.worldclim.org/) Worldclim provide raster grids of environmental data such as elevation, surface temperature and precipitation up to 30''x30'' (~1km)
* (https://www.climond.org/) An alternative to worldclim
* (http://meta2.isric.org/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home) World Soil Information
* (http://landsatlook.usgs.gov/) LANDSAT has satellite derived data freely available. LANDSAT8 is 30m x 30m resolution (Images, NDVI etc).

### Marine environment
* (http://www.myocean.eu/) MyOcean has a variety of oceangraphic data from a variety of models (Temp, Currents, Chemistry, etc)
* (http://www.oracle.ugent.be/) Marine environmental layers on a consistent grid 5' x 5' grid (~9km)
* (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/) Ocean colour web provides data access to satellite data including MODIS and SeaWIFS (e.g. NDVI, SST, SAT)
* (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA09/pr_woa09.html) The world ocean atlas a 3 dimensional grid of the oceans at 1º x 1º x 33 depth levels (Temp, Salinity etc)

### Species data
* (http://www.gbif.org/) The Global Biodiversity Information facility is a portal to museum catalogue and survey data of species observations
* (http://www.iobis.org/) The Ocean Biogeographic Information System is like GBIF, but specialises in marine species
