# Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Research Experience Placements - summer 2018

We are currently seeking applications for the summer undergraduate research experience placements listed below. The placement pays a stipend of £200 per week and last between 8 and 10 weeks, finishing before the end of September. There will be additional funding for your project expenses. 

## Project description

Building low cost camera systems for seabed surveys (with Chris Yesson, Zoological Society of London, chris.yesson@ioz.ac.uk)

Marine scientists at the Zoological Society of London have been using camera systems to monitor marine life for many years (see [this blog]( https://www.zsl.org/blogs/wild-science/capturing-kelp-with-kayaks-camera-and-acoustics "this blog") and [this blog](https://macroalgalresearchgroup.com/2017/08/29/jurassic-park-kimmeridge-bay/ "this blog") for examples). We are seeking an intern to put together a towed camera to be deployed from a kayak. This involves designing (a prototype design exists, but requires improvement), building and testing the system which will consists of off-the-shelf action camera, laser pointers and lights. The student will also work to develop a prototype laser pointer using a compact Arduino nano (or a similar micro-controller) to control components, for deployment in deep-sea Arctic habitats.

* Be applying for a placement in a different department to their undergraduate degree.
* Be undertaking their first undergraduate degree studies (or integrated Masters).
* Be expected to obtain a first or upper second class UK honours degree.
